# Chase Builder

After having been on a number of chases I became aware that it takes a large amount of effort to catalogue and present data from a chase day in a way that is easily comprehensible. While investigate some features of Google Earth I became aware that it would be a powerful tool to capture data relating to a chase day. Inbuilt to Google Earth is the ability to time code data and location, creating a large number of possible integrations for data after a chase day.

Manually organising this data to be opened in Google Earth takes a large amount of time, and to do this for every chase is not feasible. Thus the idea of a program that would automatically scan different data sources and compile into a few kml files to be opened in Google Earth was born.

The idea is to collect the chase track, radar data and media from a chase into a specific folder structure. This folder is then run through the program, which automatically scans and catalogues the files into a series of kml files that are time coded to be opened by Google Earth.

## So what is it?

Chase Builder is a program that collects radar imagery, photos, videos, time lapse, and gps tracks and bakes them together to form kml files that can be opened and overlayed in Google Earth.
